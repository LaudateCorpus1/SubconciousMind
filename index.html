        The book contains 20 chapters, each with a different chapter title and
        various sub headings within each chapter. The 20 chapters are spread on
        297 pages. The book starts with thought-provoking questions that create
        interest in the reader before embarking on chapter one. Thereafter, each
        chapter addresses itself to the powerful role, wisdom and intelligence
        of the subconscious mind in human life.

      <h2>Summary of Chapters</h2>

      <p>
        <span>Chapter 1:</span> The treasure house within you. It metaphorically
        refers to the subconscious part of us as a house with a lot of treasure.
        The treasures are clearly brought out as the principles and beliefs
        within us. The subconscious mind is intelligent and has infinite
        potential that can magnetize people to achieve more. The chapter states
        that we do not need to acquire the subconscious because we already have
        it. We only need to reach out for it (communicate with it) to release
        the hidden power. We need to tap into the mighty power of the
        subconscious mind to find solutions to our every problem. The chapter
        again metaphorical refers to the subconscious mind as a garden with rich
        soil and the only thing we should do, is to plant good thoughts. The
        chapter ends by saying that our subconscious mind accepts whatever we
        order it to do which is based upon what the conscious mind believes.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>Chapter 2:</span> How your mind works. It gives the differences
        between roles played by the subconscious and conscious mind and how they
        interact. The author clearly states that if you think good; good follows
        you and if you think evil; evil will follow you. The subconscious mind
        accepts whatever we feed it therefore it is incumbent upon us to
        consciously think of what to sow or give to the subconscious mind.
        Whatever the conscious mind accepts, the subconscious mind executes and
        that is how interrelated they are.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>Chapter 3:</span> The miracle working power of your subconscious.
        The chapter addresses that issue of how we injure our subconscious mind
        negative thoughts and advises that we have to feed the subconscious mind
        with good thought so that we wipe out the negative attitudes. We need to
        reorganize our thought patterns because the subconscious mind controls
        all the vital organs and functions even when we are asleep. The author
        again personifies the subconscious by stating that we only need to speak
        to it and it will execute our commands. The chapter ends by saying that
        the subconscious mind has healing powers, intelligence and wisdom that
        can execute our commands anytime we speak to it.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>Chapter 4:</span> Mental healings in ancient times: The author
        uses stories from the Bible about the blind men who were healed by the
        subconscious mind. Our subconscious mind heals us because we give it
        suggestions and convictions about our health. The chapter combines
        stories from ancient history, medicine world, religion and psychology to
        bring out how the suggestions we feed to the mind are very important. If
        you think you are healed, then you are by the powerful and intelligent
        subconscious mind. However faith and expectancy are deemed as key to
        ensuring that our subconscious mind can heal us.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>Chapter 5:</span> Mental healings in modern times: The author
        emphatically states that faith is the healer and through scientific
        prayers (prayer therapy) healing is achieved. Prayer is the subconscious
        and the conscious minds harmoniously working together for a definite
        purpose therefore releasing the healing power. However, faith is needed
        when communicating with your subconscious mind.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>Chapter 6:</span> Practical techniques in mental healing: It
        states that prayers are answered in a scientific way and with proper
        techniques and methods our prayers are answered. The chapter talks about
        several prayer techniques such as: passing over technique, blue print
        approach, visualization method, mental movie method, Baudain technique,
        sleeping technique, thank you technique, affirmative method,
        argumentative method, the absolute method and the decree method. The
        author outlines and gives illustrations on how to use each of the above
        prayer technique in order to achieve desired answers.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>Chapter 7:</span> The tendency of the subconscious is life ward.
        The chapter repeats what has been earlier said that feed the
        subconscious mind with good thoughts to eliminate bad ones. The
        subconscious mind is geared towards giving us healthy lives and peace
        because being sick is abnormal. Chapter 8: How to get the results you
        want. The chapter succinctly posits that not all prayers are answered
        because those who pray don't understand how it works scientifically.
        Your conscious mind must decide what it wants so that the intelligence
        of subconscious mind can start working on it. The author gives three
        steps to success in prayers: firstly, acknowledging or admitting the
        problem; secondly, turn the problem to the subconscious mind and thirdly
        rest with a sense of deep conviction that it is done.
